# Facial Keypoint Detection

## Project Overview

In this project, I've designed a LeNet based Deep CNN to predict the locations of facial keypoints on each face; examples of these keypoints are displayed below. This project was one of the projects required to obtain Udacity's Computer Vision Nanodegree.
